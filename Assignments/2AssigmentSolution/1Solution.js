// There are two basketball teams, NepalA and NepalB. They played against each other 3 times. 
// The team with the highest average score wins a trophy.

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the tournament, and print it to the console. (Can be draw as well)
// 3. Include a requirement for a minimum avergae score of 50 points. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and at the same time a score of at least 50 points.
// 4. Minimum score rule also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 50 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

// Test data:
// Test Data 1: NepalA score 46, 58 and 39. NepalB score 48, 41 and 60
// Test Data 2: NepalA score 47, 62 and 51. NepalB score 59, 45 and 73
// Test Data 3: NepalA score 47, 62 and 51. NepalB score 59, 45 and 56


let NepalA = 46 + 58 + 39;
let NepalB = 48 + 41 + 60;

let avgA = NepalA / 3;
let avgB = NepalB / 3;

// let avgAScrore = avgA - avgB;
// let avgBScrore = avgB - avgA;

let  points = 50;

if (avgA > avgB && avgA >= points) {
    console.log ("Team NepalA has win the game");
} else if (avgB > avgA && avgB >= points) {
    console.log("Team NepalB has win the game");
} else {
    console.log ("Match Draw");
